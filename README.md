Uppsala Software Factory. March 2019
---------------------------------------------

These are the famous Uppsala Software Factory programs, rescued into GitHub.
Programs in the Uppsala Software Factory were written by Gerard Kleywegt, then
at Uppsala and now at the EMBL-EBI.

The original README is in the file __README, but is out-of-date!

This Github repository contains the set of programs for crystallographic map
and model manipulation in various subdirectories. Utility routines are in the
subdirectory gklib, and are compiled into a library libgk.a  Many of the programs
also rely on CCP4 libraries, distributed as part of the CCP4 suite (www.ccp4.ac.uk).

Old binaries for Linux and OSX are in the directory OLD_BINARIES but there is no
guarantee that they will work.

I am working on an updated Makefile Makefile_with_CCP4 but progress is slow (this
is not my day job!). At some point, I will include a directory of static 64-bit executables
for Linux.
