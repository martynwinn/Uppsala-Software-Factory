                the residues flagged by OOPS2 (only works for O version
                9.0.7, or later, which has the Centre_build command)
 041001 - 1.4 - replaced Kabsch' routine U3BEST by quaternion-based
                routine (U3QION) to do least-squares superpositioning
 041021 -1.4.1- WhatCheck-handling routines now print a warning message
                when there are unlisted problems (indicated by a
                line such as "And so on for a total of 316 lines"
                in the WhatCheck output). They can now also handle
                residue names that include an insert character
                (such as "A374", "A374A", "A374B", etc.)
 041116 - 1.5 - print extra clear warning if any WHAT IF diagnostics
                were suppressed (as well as the possible remedies);
                some minor cosmetic changes
 041117 -1.5.1- option to generate macros for all residues of a certain
                type (protein, nucleic acid, water, heterogen)
                irrespective of whether they have been flagged as
                outliers (this can be handy when you want to check
                all hetero compounds, or all waters, etc.)
 070222 -1.5.2- changed output a bit so it's easier to 'grep' a
                summary of the results; increased dimensioning

 ** INTRODUCTION

 OOPS2 is the successor of ye olde faithful OOPS program as described
   in: G.J. Kleywegt & T.A. Jones (1996). Efficient rebuilding of
   protein structures. Acta Cryst D52, 829-832.  This new version
   has been streamlined, making it much less tedious to use, and
   it has some enhancements that make it more useful than OOPS.  The
   old OOPS will no longer be developed, although it remains
   available for those who find it easier to use.

 What is the idea behind OOPS2 ? It is a tool that can be used by
   beginning and experienced protein crystallographers alike to
   streamline and speed up their model rebuilding efforts.  In
   essence, all OOPS2 does is to read a load of information with
   respect to the quality of the current model, and to write a
   set of O macros that will take the crystallographer from one
   suspect residue to the next.  In this way, your attention is
   focussed on those residues with which something appears to be
   amiss, and since OOPS2 tells you what the potential problem
   is (e.g., poor fit to the density, unusual side-chain conformation)
   you can use the appropriate tools in O to take action if you
   deem that this is necessary to improve the model.

 ** BEFORE YOU START

 Before you run OOPS2, you will need the following:

 - your current model (typically, the output from a refinement
   cycle) in a PDB file
 - information regarding the quality of your current model (e.g.,
   an O datablock with pep-flip values, or a WHAT IF quality
   report)
 - a subdirectory called "oops".  This is where OOPS2 stores the
   O macros it produces. The program will quit immediately if this
   subdirectory does not exist.  To create it, under Unix you
   can type: mkdir oops

 ** QUALITY CHECKS

 At present OOPS2 can check the criteria listed below. An "[O]"
   indicates that a check requires input in the form of an
   O datablock, whereas "[WHAT IF]" means that this check
   requires input of a WHAT IF quality report.  All other checks
   are done by OOPS2 itself, calculating information as
   required on-the-fly.

 A - main-chain geometry:
 - [O] residues with bad pep-flip values
 - residues with PHI-PSI values outside the allowed regions
 - Proline residues with PHI not near -65.4 +/- 11.2 degrees
 - non-Gly residues with positive PHI
 - residues with non-planar peptides
 - residues with unusual omega torsion
 - residues with a cis-peptide

 B - side-chain geometry:
 - [O] residues with bad RSC-fit (Rotamer Sidechain) values
 - residues with poor C-alpha chirality
 - D-amino acids

 C - real-space-fit of model to density:
 - [O] RSCC (real-space corr. coeff.) for all atoms
 - [O] RSCC for the main chain atoms only
 - [O] RSCC for the side chain atoms only
 - [O] RS R-factor for all atoms

 D - temperature factors and occupancies:
 - residues with at least one atom with a too low B-factor
 - ditto, with a too high B-factor
 - residues with too high an RMS delta-B for bonded atoms
 - residues with at least one atom with a too low occupancy
 - ditto, with a too high occupancy

 E - comparison with a previous model:
 - positional shifts, changes in temperature factors and occupancies,
    large shifts in Phi/Psi and Chi1/Chi2, as well as newly inserted
    and mutated residues are flagged since they might warrant your
    inspection

 F - miscellaneous:
 - residues with at least one atom which sticks out of the mask
 - residues which violate user-defined criteria
 - disulfide bridges
 - disulfides with S=S distance not near 2.06 +/- 0.10 A
 - disulfides with CB-S-S-CB not near 96.8 +/- 10.1 degree (right-handed)
   or -85.8 +/- 8.6 degrees (left-handed)
 - [WHAT IF] a subset of WHAT IF diagnostics can be extracted from the file
   "pdbout.txt" (which is generated if the "check ful file.pdb x y"
   command is executed in WHAT IF)

 Alternatively, OOPS2 can be used to generate informative macros
   for all residues in your protein, and the macros may even have
   the same name as the residue.  So, to centre on residue A273,
   and to get a message about what is suspicious about this residue,
   all you need to type is: @oops/a273

 ** INPUT

 ## start the program

 The program will print some general information and an overview of
   the array dimensions (e.g., maximum number of atoms).

 ## statistics and histograms

 If you reply "Y", then
   for every item (where relevant), some statistics and a
   histogram of the encountered values are printed.  This may
   help you in finding a proper cut-off value.  For most
   criteria, OOPS2 comes up with fixed (sensible) defaults.
   However, for RS-fit cut-offs are calculated, IF you said
   YES to this question, as follows:

 CUTOFF = MAX (RSFmin+0.1, MIN(RSFmax-0.1,RSFave-2*RSFsigma)

 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----
 Print statistics and histograms ? (Y) y
 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----

 ## plot files

 If you said YES to the statistics question, you may also opt to
   get O2D plot files for some of the properties (e.g., pep-flip,
   rs-fit, rsc, bad-counts)

 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----
 Auto-generate (some) O2D plot files ? (N) no

 ## molecule name in O

 Name of the current molecule (in O !!), e.g.: M9.  This
   will be used to centre on the correct residues when you run
   the O macros created by OOPS2, and to validate the name of
   O datablocks that you read in OOPS2

 ## user feedback

 If you made use of the option to annotate your previous model's
   residues with your own subjective assessment of the quality of the
   model and density, OOPS2 will read the results of that. If you
   don't have the foggiest what I'm on about - don't worry your
   pretty little head :-)

 ** COMMAND LOOP

 At this stage, the old OOPS would continue to ask you a zillion
   questions.  In OOPS2 the initiative has been put into the hands
   of the user instead.  OOPS2 enters a command loop, and you add
   (or remove, if you made a mistake) those quality checks you
   want to include.  If external information (e.g., an O datablock)
   is required, the program will ask you for the filename. For
   some criteria a cut-off value is required, but OOPS2 attempts
   to come up with reasonable default values.

 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----

 PEP = include pep-flip                  RSC = include rotamer

 Next command ? (?) 
 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----

 ## QUI = quit without doing anything

 If you select this option, OOPS2 will terminate without writing
   any files or doing anything at all for that matter.

 ## PEP = pep-flip
 
 Switch the analysis of pep-flip values on or off. If you include it,
   provide the name of the pep-flip datablock file and a
   cut-off of what you consider to be "bad pep-flips" (e.g., 2.5 \A).

 ## RSC = rotamer

 Switch the analysis of RSC values on or off (RSC = Rotamer Side Chain
   fit, a measure of how closely your side-chain conformation resembles
   that of the most similar rotamer in the O database; not used for Gly
   and Ala residues). If you include it, provide the name of the rsc
   datablock file and a cut-off value (e.g., 1.0 \A).

 ## WIF = WHAT IF diagnostics

 OOPS2 can read "pdbout.txt" files created by WHAT IF (with the
   command: "check ful filename.pdb x y").  A subset of the diagnostics
   is used literally by OOPS2.  If you don't use "nit-picking mode"
   some diagnostics will be ignored.  For literature references,
   see the WHAT IF output file.

 Note: as of version 1.2.6, the program always operates in
   "nit-picking mode".

 Note: if the program prints a warning message telling you something
   like ""And so on for a total of 316 lines" occurred in the WhatIf
   or WhatCheck output you should take action. It means that there
   are more diagnostic messages than WhatIf is allowed to print, and
   hence that you will miss possibly important information during
   rebuilding ! You can increase the number of messages that WhatIf
   is allowed to print by either issuing the command "setwif 593 100000"
   before you run the check, or by editing the program's parameter
   file (PARAMS.FIG) and changing the value of parameter number 593
   (which is 50 by default) to a large number, e.g. 100000.

   absolute deviation from zero .
 The omega torsion (CA-C-N-CA) is also checked, and any cis-peptides

 ## PRE = previous model

 Switch comparison with a previous model on or off. If you include
   it, provide the name of the PDB file containing that model.
 The following items are checked for each residue of the
   current model:
 o has the residue newly been inserted ?
 o has the residue newly been mutated ?
 If not:
 o has it shifted "a lot" ?
 o have the temperature factors changed a lot ?
 o have the occupancies changed a lot ?
 o have the Phi and/or Psi angles changed a lot ?
 o have the Chi1 and (if present) Chi2 angles changed a lot ?

 You have to provide a cut-off for each of these checks in
   order to define what "a lot" actually is.  In all cases, when
   a large shift has occurred (either during rebuilding or
   refinement), you want to have a closer look at the residue.
   The same is true, of course, if you have recently mutated or
   inserted a residue.

 Delta-dihedral angles are calculated as:
     dihedral (now) - dihedral (previous)
   and moved to fall in the range <-180,+180].

 If only one of Phi and Psi can be calculated, then the 
   "Phi/Psi distance" is simply the absolute value of the
   delta-dihedral; if both can be calculated, the distance
   is calculated as SQRT (0.5 * (dPhi**2 + dPsi**2) ).
   A similar method is used for the Chi1/2 distance.

 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----

 ** GO !

 If you select the "GO " command, OOPS2 will start producing its
   output files. But a few more questions will have to be answered
   first.

 ## user-defined criteria

 You can check one or more (up to ten) user-defined criteria ?
   provide a file name (this MUST be an O-style datablock;
   both Integer and Real datablocks can be read, but the
   values are always stored as REAL), a name for the property,
   and the message to print in O when a residue has a "bad"
   value for this property.  You must also make clear WHEN
   a residue has a bad value, i.e. whether VALUE > CUT-OFF or
   VALUE < CUT-OFF is considered bad.  In order to do this,
   you must supply a comparison operator (either < or >) and
   a cut-off value.

 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----
 Next command ? (?) go

 User-definable criteria
 Max number of them : (      10) 

 Enter file with user datablock (<CR> to stop): ( ) 

 Nr of user criteria : (       0) 
 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----

 ## extra files

 An "electronic notebook file" will automatically be created. Just
   edit this file as you go along rebuilding your model.  At the end,
   print the file and stick it in your real notebook.

 In addition, an HTML model critique file, which contains a
   residue-by-residue critique of your model to put on your web site or
   intranet server will also automatically be created.

 The names of these files are fixed, so no user input is required.

 ## O commands for each residue

 You can enter one line of O commands to execute for each residue. 
   It is handy to draw your maps and a sphere object, for example:
 fm_dr sigma fm_dr diff obj sph sphere 10 end bell

 If you want to execute an awful lot of commands for every
   "baddy", put them in a macro and just execute that:
 @do_all_this_for_every_baddy.omac

 If you don't want to do anything, supply a comment line:
 ! don't do anything

 or a dummy message:
 message Check this one out, babe !

 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----
 You may enter one line of O commands which will be
 executed by EVERY macro generated by OOPS.
 O command(s) to execute in every macro ? (bell   save   print DONE and 
  SAVED) 
 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----

 ## output macros

 - do you want macros for ALL or only for the BAD residues ?
   If you want to be use OOPS as an information-macro-generator,
   choose ALL; for rebuilding of only suspicious residues,
   choose BAD

 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----
 You may opt to get macros for ALL or merely the
 BAD residues.
 Do you want macros for ALL residues ? (N) 
 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----

 - if you don't want macros for all residues, you may still want
   macros for all residues of a certain kind (e.g., all heterogens).
   This can be accomplished from version 1.5.1 on:

 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----
 Alternatively, you may opt to get macros for all
 residues (good or bad) of a certain type (protein,
 nucleic acid, water, heterogen).
 Do you want macros for certain types ? (N) y
 Macros for all amino acids ? (N) 
 Macros for all nucleotides ? (N) 
 Macros for all waters      ? (N) y
 Macros for all heterogens  ? (N) y
 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----

 - decide on whether or not to use user feedback information
   (assuming you have generated such information in an earlier
   cycle of OOPS2 followed by rebuilding):

 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----
 If you wish, residues that you have previously flagged
 as "good density, good fit" can be skipped by OOPS,
 even if they would normally be flagged as "bad" (e.g.,
 due to an unusual side-chain conformation).
 Skip good residues ? (N) y

 Conversely, residues that you have previously flagged
 as having poor density or a poor fit can be flagged by
 OOPS, even if they are not flagged as "bad".
 Include poor residues ? (N) y
 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----

 - do you want CHAINED macros ?  If so, each macro will "point
   to" the next one; it will put an O instruction on the O menu
   to execute the next macro.  If you want to be use OOPS as an
   information-macro-generator, select NO; for rebuilding of only
   suspicious residues, select YES

 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----
 You may opt to get chained macros or individual macros
 without instructions to put the next macro on the menu.
 Do you want CHAINED macros ? (Y) 
 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----

 - do you want macros to be executed "from N to C terminus" or
   do you want to start with the residues that have the largest
   number of diagnostics ? One could use the latter option if
   one is in a hurry and only wants to inspect those residues
   that seem to have the most serious problems.

 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----
 The macros can be executed either from first residue to
 last, or starting with the residue with the highest
 number of possible problems ("worst-first").
 Do you want the macros "WORST-FIRST" ? (N) 
 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----

 - do you want to use the Grab_build panel in O to rebuild the
   residues flagged by the program ? Depending on your choice
   here, two symbols are defined in the "oops.omac" macro,
   namely oops_c_atom and oops_c_zone. If you use Grab_build,
   then both symbols will be set to "centre_build"; otherwise
   they will be set to "centre_atom" and "centre_zone", 
   respectively. You can always redefine these symbols if
   you regret your choice while you are rebuilding.

 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----
 From O version 9.0.7 on, you can opt to use the Grab_build
 panel for every residue flagged by OOPS2.
 Do you want to use GRAB_BUILD ? (Y) n
 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----

 ## action

 OOPS2 will now loop over all residues.  If a residue has a bad
   pep-flip or rs-fit value etc., a macro will be written to the
   oops subdirectory (unless you requested macros for ALL residues).
   In addition, a start-up macro called "oops.mac" will be put in
   your current directory.

 In the case of pepflip values etc., only residues which have
   absolute values greater than 0.01 are considered (this is to
   prevent OOPS from flagging all your waters as having bad
   RS-fit values, or your terminal residues as having bad PHI/PSI
   values).  Similar safe-guards are applied for other attributes
   (e.g.: RS-fit side-chain not for GLYs; RSC not for GLY/ALA;
   phi/psi not for N- and C-terminal residues, etc. etc.).

 ## using the macros

 When OOPS2 is finished (and if there were any bad residues), all
   you have to do is type: "@oops.omac" from within O.  This
   will then automatically centre on the first bad residue and
   print a message which tells you what is suspicious about this
   residue.  In addition, a new menu item "@oops/2" will be added
   to your menu.  When you're finished with the first residue, just
   click on this new menu item to go the second suspicious residue
   automatically, etc. ad infinitum.  When the second macro is
   executed, you again will be centred on this residue's C-alpha
   atom, a diagnostic message is printed, the previous menu item
   "@oops/2" is deleted and a new one, "@oops/3" is inserted.
   Again, when you're finished, just click on "@oops/3" and voila.

 After the last "baddy", the terminal bell will ring and a
   message that there aren't any more of them is printed.

 ** USER-FEEDBACK: SUBJECTIVITY

 In OOPS2, a facility has been implemented that enables
   you to keep track of your subjective judgement of all the
   residues you inspect with the OOPS2 macros.

 As you execute the "oops.omac" start-up macro, four new commands
   will be added to your menu:
 - @Good_fit
 - @Poor_fit
 - @Poor_dens
 - @No_dens

 Also, a new datablock will be created (and filled with zeros)
   that is called MOLNAM_residue_quality (MOLNAM is the name
   of the molecule you are scrutinising, e.g. M9).  Now, whenever
   you inspect a residue, you can click on any of the four new
   commands, and the entry of the current residue will be set
   to:
 o 0 if you click on @Good_fit: the density is good, and the fit
   of the model to the density is good
 o 1 if you click on @Poor_fit: the density is good, but the fit
   of the model to the map is not, i.e. you need to do some
   rebuilding
 o 2 if you click on @Poor_dens: the density is poor, so you cannot
   fit the residue any better than it is
 o 3 if you click on @No_dens: there is no density, so you cannot
   reasonably fit the residue at all
 While you are still working on the same residue, you can revise
   your judgement, and press another of the four commands.

 When you are done, a new CA-object will be generated (called QUAL),
   where residues with quality value 0 are green, value 1 red (these
   should have been fixed by you), value 2 magenta (may have been
   rebuilt in the hopes of better density next cycle), and value 3
   white (no density, little hope at present).  You can use this
   object, for example, to ask a colleague or your supervisor to
   have a (quick) look at the problematic residues. (Residues
   which you have not judged have a value of -1 and will be drawn
   in blue.)

 You can also use it in a next rebuilding cycle to quickly skip
   over residues that are flagged as outliers (e.g., in pepflip
   or rotamer analysis), but for which you know that the density and
   the fit to it are rock solid, and conversely to include
   residues that were a problem in the previous cycle even though
   OOPS2 may not have found anything wrong with them this time
   around.

 The results of your assessment are stored in a file called
   "oops_subjectivity.table" (once you have executed the
   final OOPS2 macro), and read the next time you run the
   program.

 The file may looks as follows:

 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----

 And when you're about to generate new macros:

 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----
 If you wish, residues that you have previously flagged
 as "good density, good fit" can be skipped by OOPS,
 even if they would normally be flagged as "bad" (e.g.,
 due to an unusual side-chain conformation).
 Skip good residues ? (N) y

 Conversely, residues that you have previously flagged
 as having poor density or a poor fit can be flagged by
 OOPS, even if they are not flagged as "bad".
 Include poor residues ? (N) y

 ** NOTES AND HINTS

 ## Colouring your molecule

 colouring your molecule according to the number of violations:

 EXAMPLE 1:

 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----
  O > read oops_badcounts.o
  O > mol m6a
  O > pai_ramp residue_badcounts ; blue red
  O > obj bad ca ; end
 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----

 EXAMPLE 2:

 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----
  O > read oops_badcounts.o
  O > mol m6a
  O > pai_prop atom_name = ca blue
  O > pai_prop residue_badcounts > 0 red
  O > obj bad ca ; end
 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----

 EXAMPLE 3:

 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----
  O > read oops_badcounts.o
  O > mol m6a
  O > pai_case residue_badcounts 5  0 1 2 3 4  blue green yellow orange red
  O > obj bad ca ; end

 ## Using quality information from other programs

 use ODBM or ODBMAN to create O-style datablock files from ASCII files.
 ODBMAN and ODBM can also be used to extract several types of
   datablock from a PROCHECK output file (see their manuals) !

 ## O commands for each residue

 when prompted by OOPS2 to supply a line of O commands which
   will be executed for every bad residue, be clever and execute
   a macro !  For example: @do_all.omac
 You may then change the contents of this macro later on without
   having to re-run OOPS2.

 ## Generating O datablocks for OOPS2

 Use the OMAC/pre_oops.omac macro to take some work out of your
   hands.

 ## Converting plot files to PostScript

 Converting the O2D plot files generated by OOPS2 into PostScript
   format is conveniently done with the OMAC/o2dps script.

 ## Consistency checks

 OOPS2 always checks if the names of datablocks are consistent, to help
   you prevent using a datablock belonging to an old model:

 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----
 Analyse RS R-factor (all atoms) ? (Y) 
 O data block with RS R-factors  ? (rsrfac_all.o) 
 Datablock : (M18_RESIDUE_RSRCONV) 
 Data type : (R) 
 Number    : (238) 
 Format    : ((f10.3)) 
 WARNING - inconsistent datablock name
 Expected    : (m18_residue_rsfit) 
 Encountered : (m18_residue_rsrconv) 
 Continue anyway ? (Y) 
 ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE ----- EXAMPLE -----

 ** KNOWN BUGS

 There is a problem with entities that only occur in one alternate
 location that is not " " or "A" (e.g., waters associated with the
 "B" location of some residue). O will put these in a separate molecule
 and therefore not generate an RS-fit value for them etc. This leads
 to a mismatch between O and OOPS2. The simplest way around this is
 the rename the alt. loc. indicator of such entities to "A" or " "
 before reading the file into O and OOPS2 (but use the correct file
 in WHAT IF to make sure the bump checks are carried out correctly).
