 ** DESCRIPTION

 SSENCS takes as input a file that contains SSEs (secondary structure
   elements, i.e., helices and strands) in DEJAVU format, and tries
   to find NCS operators relating subsets of the SSEs. It was written
   back in 2001 and not released until five years later. I have never
   tested it on real cases, so I make no claims as to its utility.
   There are newer and much cleverer programs around. The idea here
   is to use the SSEs out of some map-interpretation program (even
   something as simple as ESSENS) and look for NCS relationships.
   If you have a partial model you can also generate an SSE file
   from that using GETSSE (part of the DEJAVU package). Well, even
   if this program shouldn't be of any use, at least it's very
   fast so you won't waste too much time ;-)

 The format of a DEJAVU-style SSE file is as follows (only lines
   starting with 'ALPHA ' or 'BETA  ' will actually be read):

 So there is one line for each SSE, starting (in column 1-6) with
   the type (ALPHA or BETA) and followed by: a name (arbitrary),
   first and last residue name (arbitrary), the number of
   residues in it, and the XYZ coordinates of the first and the
   last CA atom in it.

 ** ALGORITHM

 The algorithm proceeds in a number of steps:

 (1) Finding seed SSEs.
 The first step is to find SSEs that are suitable as seeds to
   start generating RT operators in the next step. Such SSEs
   should have at least one "partner" SSE that is of the same
   type (helix/strand), has a similar length and a similar
   number of residues. For each SSE, all such partners are
   enumerated, and if the SSE also has a nearby neighbour
   (of any type), it is stored in a list of seed SSEs.

 (2) Generating RT operators and SSE triples.
 Each pair of seed and partner SSEs is enumerated, and investigated
   if their nearest neighbour is of the same type. Since each SSE
   has a start and end point, we obtain a set of four points for
   each SSE plus neighbours, to be compared to four points in the
   partner and its neighbour. Since the directionality of the SSEs
   may be uncertain, all four possible ways of matching these four
   points are attempted (quaternion least-squares fitting routine), and
   the combination that gives the smallest RMSD is kept, as is the
   corresponding RT operator (and start/end coordinates will be swapped
   if necessary). If the RMSD does not exceed a user-supplied
   cut-off, the operator is applied to all remaining SSEs to identify
   a further SSE that is a neighbour of the original partner, and that
   (after applying the RT operator) has a centre-to-centre distance
   that is smaller than a certain cut-off. (If there is more than one,
   the SSE that gives the smallest such distance is used.) If this
   step is successfull, this provides an RT operator that relates
   (at least) a triple of SSE centres with a relatively small RMSD.
   However, in this way many operators would be generated more than
   once. Therefore, if an operator is similar to a previously
   generated one, it will be discarded. This is done by applying
   the operators to a fixed test vector t (e.g., (100 100 100)) and
   to measure the distance between RTi(t) and RTj(t) for two operators
   "i" and "j". If this distance is smaller than a certain cut-off,
   the operators are considered to be identical.

 (3) Evaluating the RT operators.
 In the final step, each of the operators is applied to all of the
   SSEs, and pairs of SSEs are gathered that are of the same type,
   and whose centre-to-centre distance (after applying the operator
   to one of them) is smaller than a cut-off. In addition, their
   start-to-start and end-to-end point distances must be smaller
   than the same cut-off (again, start and end will be swapped if
   this gives the better fit). If at least two matching SSEs are
   found, their start and end points are used to calculate a new
   operator, and the new operator is applied to all SSEs again,
   etc. until the number of SSEs that obey the operator does no
   longer increase. At that stage the operator, the number of matching
   SSEs, and the RMSD of their start and end points are stored.
   Finally, the operators are sorted by the number of SSEs that
   obey them, and the top solutions are listed.

 ** EXAMPLE

 The following is a synthetic example. It uses SSEs generated from
   1PMP, expanded under space-group symmetry, and only keeping the
   SSEs that are entirely within the unit cell [0,1][0,1][0,1],
   and using default input parameters.

 Note: the first two operators are pure spacegroup symmetry operators.
   In general the operators will be combinations of SGS and NCS operators
   (both sets include the Identity operator, of course).

 Note: several operators are identical in the output list. This is
   probably due to the iterative operator evaluation. They were
   probably slightly different to begin with, but not similar
   enough to be caught by the test-vector filter. But in the iterative
   evaluation procedure they "catch" the same set of SSEs and end
   up being identical anyway.

 Note: for each operator that is obeyed by the minimum number of SSEs
   required, up to 15 of the matching SSE pairs are printed, so
   the user can search for operators that relate to the same
   set of SSEs. In a real case, one could generate a quick and dirty
   mask at that stage (e.g., using Randy Read's method as implemented
   in COMA) and throw it into IMP to improve the operators.
